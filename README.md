A map showing the abridged travels of David Fairchild, food explorer.
More than a century ago, starting in the 1890s, Fairchild worked for the United States Department of Agriculture, journeying around the world to send back seeds or cuttings of over 200,000 kinds of fruits, vegetable and grains. His department, the Office of Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction, researched and distributed new crops to farmers around the states.
Overall he went to more than 50 countries and changed the American botanical landscape forever
